Amazon Pinpoint helps you understand user behavior, define which users to target, determine which messages to send, schedule the best time to deliver the messages, and then track the results of your campaign.Targeted push notifications based on app usage trends and user behavior have become a popular approach for mobile app user engagement because response rates are often several times higher than tradition email marketing campaigns. By using targeted push notifications, you can increase message relevance and effectiveness, measure engagement, and continually improve your campaigns.Getting started with Amazon Pinpoint is easy. First, AWS Mobile Hub guides you through the process to integrate the AWS Mobile SDK with your app. Next, you define your target segments, campaign message, and specify the delivery schedule. Once your campaign is running, Pinpoint provides metrics so you can run analytics and track the impact of your campaign.With Amazon Pinpoint, there are no upfront setup costs, and no fixed monthly cost.
